## Note: This is a fork coming from
[graphql-binding](https://github.com/dotansimha/graphql-binding)

It required separation because I couldn't make modifications to my forked master or create tags
which resulted in issues. Additionally, running yarn add <git repository> caused issues with
finding the package in the root-level node_modules directory despite it being present.
As a result, the "fork" is here.
